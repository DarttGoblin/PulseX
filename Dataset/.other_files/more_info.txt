Aortic Stenosis (AS): Narrowing of the aortic valve, restricting blood flow from the heart to the body.

Mitral Regurgitation (MR): The mitral valve does not close completely, allowing blood to flow backward into the left atrium.
Mitral Stenosis (MS): Narrowing of the mitral valve, restricting blood flow into the left ventricle.
Multi-Disease (MD): Indicates whether a patient has multiple heart diseases.
